        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I'm a young professional aspiring to make my own mark on the world one way or another. I recently graduated from <strong>Towson University</strong> with a degree in <strong>Mass Communications</strong> with a focus in advertising. I currently work as a Digital Media Marketing Assistant for a2z, inc. </P>
          <p>I think an open mind and a strong set of morals are the most important characteristics one can have. Change is one of the few constants in life, and I welcome it as it brings new oppurtunities that may have been missed otherwise.</p>

        <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
        <p>I'm from a small cow town located on Maryland's eastern shore. I'm sure some of you may be scratching your head asking "Wut is he talking about, an Eastern Shore?" With a 4:1 chicken-to-human ratio it's not a place I'd recommend investigating. Trust me...</p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>What Are your Favorite Hobbies?</h2>
          <p>I am an avid action sports fan. My parents bought me my first skateboard when I was 13, and now eleven years later I still haven't learned how to put it down. More recently in life I've pursued snowboarding, mountian biking, and road cycling to get my daily adreneline fix, and have no desire to slow down.</p>
          <h2>What's your Dream Job?</h2>
          <p>My dream job would be to work for any of the action sports companies I've grown up with and support now. Specifically, I'd love to make the designs for skateboards and snowboards, or help design marketing collatteral for a big name cycling company (looking at you Specialized...)</p>
          <h2 class="music">What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
          <p>Lately I've really enjoyed psychadellic legends like Hendrix or the Doors. I've also a more contemporary taste for electronic music. I love surfing soundcloud to find new music from underground DJ's around the world.</p>
